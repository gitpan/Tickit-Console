NAME
    `Tickit::Console' - build full-screen console-style applications

CONSTRUCTOR
  $console = Tickit::Console->new( %args )
    Returns a new instance of a `Tickit::Console'. Takes the following named
    arguments:

    on_line => CODE
            Callback to invoke when a line of text is entered in the entry
            widget.

             $on_line->( $console, $text )

METHODS
  $tab = $console->add_tab( %args )
    Adds a new tab to the console, and returns an object representing it.

    Takes the following named arguments:

    name => STRING
            Name for the tab.

    on_line => CODE
            Optional. Provides a different callback to invoke when a line of
            text is entered while this tab is active. Invoked the same way
            as above.

    See TAB OBJECTS below for more information about the returned object.

  $index = $console->active_tab_index
  $tab = $console->active_tab
  $console->activate_tab( $tab_or_index )
  $console->next_tab
  $console->prev_tab
    These methods are all passed through to the underlying
    Tickit::Widget::Tabbed object.

TAB OBJECTS
  $name = $tab->name
  $tab->set_name( $name )
    Returns or sets the tab name text

  $tab->add_line( $string, %opts )
    Appends a line of text to the tab. `$string' may either be a plain perl
    string, or an instance of String::Tagged containing formatting tags, as
    specified by Tickit::Widget::Scroller. Options will be passed to the
    Tickit::Widget::Scroller::Item::Line used to contain the string.
